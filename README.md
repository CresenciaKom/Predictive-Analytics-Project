Project Title: Predicting Profit Using Transaction Data

Project Summary:
This project focuses on predicting the profit generated from individual sales transactions using machine learning regression models. Utilizing a sales transaction dataset, we explore the data, preprocess it, and train two predictive models: Multiple Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor. The models are compared based on standard regression metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²) to determine the most effective approach for this dataset. Key drivers of profit according to the best model are also identified.

Project Objectives
*   Develop and compare machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict transaction profit.
*   Identify the key features (e.g., Amount, Quantity, Category, State) that most influence profit predictions.
*   Evaluate model performance using appropriate regression metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²).
*   Provide insights into profit drivers that can inform business strategy.
